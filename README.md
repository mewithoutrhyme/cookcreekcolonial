## Working Notes

Working on updating the responsiveness of the site. (03.24.2023) - complete

* Responsiveness completed. Now, when uploaded to site/server, there are load issues with flickity images and box resizing. I remember reading something about code to hold box sizing while images continue to load. Have to look into fixing that and also the js for removing the advance arrows on flickity. 

* Other adjustements desired include 

    1. On main page, at the smaller sizes I would like to change the last picture to just a fade in and not a slide. And probably make the last text box static

    2. On discover page, on the middle sizes where the text gets to be much longer than the images, I would like to add a second image on a display/none/block/toggle.
